  <div class="container1">
    <ul>
      <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1.</li>
      <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
      <li>External -by using a link a element to link an external CSS file.</li>

        The most common way to add CSS ,is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files.However ,<span class="c4"
          >in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span
        >
        because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you try it
        yourself

    When comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a
    style to multiple elements .ID ,on the other hand ,applies a style to one
    unique element .ID is also special in that you can special URL to link
    directly to an element and it'used by Javascript
  </p>
  <p>In  CSS, selector  are used to target  a specific  element  or range  of element on a web page .Once  an element  has been targeted ,a style or set of style can be applied to the element  </p>
<p>There is wide range of selector available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID .Both are used to target element  to which a style  should be applied</p>
